## Tips

try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!==`, `!=`, `!`) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the node command in your terminal.
Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.
To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

### Sample Code From Lunch.js

Below is the testing for the lunch.js file.

```javascript
console.log("I'm hungry and I have 20 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 20);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 50 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 50);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm not hungry and I have 30 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(false, 30);
console.log("---");

console.log("I'm hungry and I have 15 minutes for lunch.");
whatToDoForLunch(true, 15);
```
